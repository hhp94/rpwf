`{rpwf}` allows data engineering in R with [{tidymodels}](https://www.tidymodels.org/) 
and running the generated workflow sets using python's very mature ML framework  [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). 
To facilitate this, a SQLite database is created to handles all the paths and 
information needed to fit models between R and Python. On top of the 
wonderful experience manipulating data in R, `{rpwf}` also enables the ability 
to use the generation of hyper parameter grids using the [{dials}](https://dials.tidymodels.org/) functions
such as [`grid_max_entropy`](https://dials.tidymodels.org/reference/grid_max_entropy.html) and etc. for
grid search in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

The combination of automated handling of paths and files with SQLite and provided 
python CLI templates aims to make feature engineering on HPCs a smoother 
experience.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{rpwf}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hhp94/rpwf")
```

After installing the package, make sure to either download the python codes at 
[this link](https://github.com/hhp94/rpwf/tree/master/inst/python/rpwf) or 
run the function:  

``` r
rpwf::rpwf_cp_py_codes(<project root path here>)
```

Then, install the package as a local package with pip with `python -m pip install -e <path to the downloaded folder>` so that the imports works.
